## Dependency ##

~~Use [lisp-matrix](https://github.com/blindglobe/lisp-matrix) to calculate matrix~~
I write by myself

All operations which I used in code be store in `toolbox`

## Algorithm ##

[x] gradient-descent
[x] logistic-regression
[x] K-mean
[ ] support-vector-machine
[ ] neural-network

## Test Data

The only two modules I tested are logistic-regression and gradient-descent. All test data in `testdata` folder, and they come from [Stanford machine learning course online](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

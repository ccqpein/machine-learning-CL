## Dependency ##

~~Use [lisp-matrix](https://github.com/blindglobe/lisp-matrix) to calculate matrix~~

I write matrix opration by myself

All operations which I used in code be store in `toolbox`

## Algorithm ##

* [x] gradient-descent
* [x] logistic-regression
* [x] K-mean
* [ ] support-vector-machine
* [ ] neural-network

## Todo ##

Should I add plot module in code?? 
I choice [vgplot](https://github.com/volkers/vgplot) be ploting package

## Test Data

The only two modules I tested are logistic-regression and gradient-descent. All test data in `testdata` folder, and they come from [Stanford machine learning course online](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
